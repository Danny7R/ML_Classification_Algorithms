# Machine Learning Classification Algorithms
This repo contains Python implementation of fundamental machine learning classification algorithms. All algorithms heve been coded from scratch (no libraries) for a deep understanding of how each works. The algorithms include:
- Linear Regression Classifier with ridge regularization
- Gaussian naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- kernel Logistic Regression
- Neural Network Classifier with one or two hidden layer(s)

_"classalgorithms.py"_ contains the implementation of the algorithms with each of them having their own separate class.
