# Machine Learning Classification Algorithms
This repo contains Python implementation of fundamental machine learning classification algorithms. All algorithms heve been coded from scratch (no libraries) for a deep understanding of how each works. The algorithms include:
- Linear Regression Classifier with ridge regularization
- Gaussian naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- kernel Logistic Regression
- Neural Network Classifier with one or two hidden layer(s)

_"script_classify.py"_ is the main script which instantiates and compares the performances of the classifiers. _"classalgorithms.py"_ contains the actual implementations of the algorithms with each of them having their own separate class. Functions used to load the required datasets are available in _"dataloader.py"_, and _"utilities.py"_ provides other useful functions needed throughout the codes.
